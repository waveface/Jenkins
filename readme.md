#Introduction

This is more like a **backup** for our mission critical Jenkins server. 

For the next time you need to update Jenkins settings, you can just update it in your box which means more efficient and secure.

*OS X*
	brew install jenkins
	git clone git@github.com:waveface/Jenkins.git ~/.jenkins
	java -jar /usr/local/Cellar/jenkins/1.447/lib/jenkins.war

*Windows*
	TODO windows instructions HERE
